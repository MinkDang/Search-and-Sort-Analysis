# üîé Search and üóÉ Sort Algorithms Analysis

## üß© Version Details

1. `Search_v1`: Search for 1 item with time taken details included
2. `Search_v2`: Automated search for all values within array, returning *performance visualisation* between different search algorithms
3. `Sort_v1`: Sort an customise array and return bar chart visualisation

## üìç Requirements

### üõ† Language: **Python 3.6** or above

### üì¶ Libraries

These can be installed through running the `start.bat` file **(Windows only)**

Install manually through your system terminal through `pip install package` *(e.g: `pip install pandas`)*

numpy | ipython | pandas | matplotlib
--- | --- | --- | ---
Search_v1 | Search_v1 |  
Search_v2 | Search_v2 | Search_v2 | Search_v2
Sort_v1 | Sort_v1

## üóù Operation

1. `.ipynb` is the **recommended** format, to be used in environments that allow Jupyter Notebook execution

2. `.py` can be executed by running `start.bat` file or from your system terminal

> Batch script is case sensitive

## ‚è≥ Performance notes

**Linear** Search is time, power - consuming.

**Sorting** is not very time-efficient with longer arrays.
