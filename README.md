# üîé Search and üóÉ Sort Algorithms Analysis

## üß© Version Details

1. `Search_v1`: Search for 1 item with time taken details included
2. `Search_v2`: Automated search for all values within array, returning *performance visualisation* between different search algorithms

## üìç Requirements

### üõ† Language: **Python 3.6** or above

### üì¶ Libraries:

These can be installed through running the `start.bat` file **(Windows only)**

Install manually through your system terminal through `pip install package` *(e.g: `pip install pandas`)*

* numpy
* ipython
* pandas *(Not used in version 1)*
* matplotlib *(Not used in version 1)*

## üóù Operation

1. `.ipynb` is a **recommended** format, to be used in environments that allow Jupyter Notebook execution

2. `.py` can be executed by running `start.bat` file or from your system terminal

> What VERSION are you running (1 or 2)?

Possible input
* `1` for `Search_v1.py`
* `2` for `Search_v2.py`

## ‚è≥ Performance notes

    Please note that LINEAR search will consume much more performance and time than BINARY search

### Testing specs:

Computer

* CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-1035G1 CPU @ 1.00GHz, 1190 Mhz, 4 Core(s), 8 Logical Processor(s)
* RAM: 16GB
* CPU Usage: 50% by `python.exe`

Data setup

* Seed: 1
* Min: 1
* Max: 1,000,000
* Array length before duplication removal: 100,000

**Result**:

* Binary Search: 2 seconds
* Linear Search - *Sorted*, Linear Search - *Unsorted*: 4 minutes each ‚Üí 8 minutes in total
* Graphing - 5 to 10 seconds
